#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# Upgrade a report server database to the most recent version.
#
# Usage:
#   ./upgrade_report_server_db.sh [-h] [-l] [-v] 
#                                [-s server] [-p port] [-d database] [-U user]
#
#   This should be executed from a directory where the OS user has 
#   the permission to write, because the script writes errors and other messages
#   to a log file named "logfile" in the script's directory.
#
#   Unless a different role (user) is specified with the -U option, this will 
#   attempt to connect to the report server database using the role 
#   "report_server_app", which is the role used by the report server application
#   itself to connect to the report server application. To simplify execution
#   of this script, the PostgreSQL password for this user can be placed in the
#   .pgpass file of the OS user's account from which this script is executed; 
#   otherwise, the user will be prompted for this password each time this script
#   is run.
#
# Prerequisites:
#
#     The report server database must already exist.

NAME
    %s -- Create a report server database and owner role in a PostgreSQL cluster.

SYNOPSIS
    %s

DESCRIPTION
    Upgrades an existing report server database.

OPTIONS
    -h    Prints a help message and then quits.

    -l    Prints out last few lines of log file. The command to do this is
          also displayed in order to show the location of the log file.

    -v    Prints the version and then quits.

    -s server
          Specifies the hostname of the PostgreSQL server to connect to.

    -p port
          Specifies the TCP port number that the PostgreSQL server is listening
          on.

    -d database
          Specifies the name of the report server database that will be 
          upgraded.

    -U user
          Specifies the PostgreSQL role name to use for connecting to the report
          server database.
