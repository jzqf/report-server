# Properties from this file are loaded by Spring Boot's SpringApplication and 
# added to the Spring Environment. This occurs only when this application is 
# bootstrapped and launched from a Java main method by Spring Boot,e.g., via:
#	$ mvn spring-boot:run
# or
#	$ java -jar <appname>.war	(for an executable WAR file)
# This file is *not* used at all when tests are run by the Maven Surefire 
# plug-in or when the application starts from a WAR file installed in a servlet
# container such as Tomcat.
#
# This file is also used for INTEGRATION tests using Spring Boot's embedded
# Tomcat. It is *not* necessary to place a separate copy of this file in
# /src/test/resources.
#
# This file currently exists only to hold these comments to document how/when
# this file is used.

# This sets the application context path for the case when this application is
# run via "mvn spring-boot:run". This should be the same context path that is
# used when the application is deployed to a servlet container as a WAR file.
