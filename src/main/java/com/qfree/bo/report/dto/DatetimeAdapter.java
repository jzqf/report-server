	/**
	 * This method unmarshals datetimes specified as strings in JSON resources
	 * to Java Date's. The JSON objects are are submitted to this application
	 * via HTTP POST or PUT. They can be expressed in any time zone, as long as
	 * the offset from GMT is explicitly specified, either via "Z" or "Â±hh:mm".
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * Important: The string representing the datetime <b><i>must</i></b> have a
	 * time zone specified. See the second line in the table below where a time
	 * zone is not specified. The resulting timestamp value is not what is
	 * expected (a time component of 11:00:00). The reason why the result is
	 * 11:00:00 is probably because the following conversion occurs deep inside
	 * the JVM:
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * When "1958-05-06T12:00:00.000" is used to create a Java Date, Java
	 * assumes that this is for the current time zone where this code is
	 * executing. In this case it is CEST = UTC+2. If this Java Date were to be
	 * converted to a string with .toString(), I believe the result would be:
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * "Tue May 06 11:00:00 CET 1958",
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * which is "correct, but referenced relative to CET, not CEST. When stored
	 * in a PostgreSQL "timestamp without timezone" column, the time zone is
	 * discarded, leaving:
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * 1958-05-06 11:00:00
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * Examples:

	 * <tr>
	 * <td>String from JSON object</td>
	 * <td>Value stored in PostgreSQL timestamp column</td>
